PlasticFee Community is a brand new decentralized platform, or rather called DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), where every registered user, called Contributor,
can express his opinion about projects proposals made to make community grow and improve constantly.

Every single contribution has the same importance as the others, so that every user has an equal power in making decisions for the community.
